3. Technologies Used

3.1 Frontend

HTML/CSS: The website's structure and styling are built using HTML5 and CSS3 to ensure responsiveness across various devices.

JavaScript: Used for dynamic interactions, including forms, appointment bookings, and integrating features like the Owl Carousel for testimonials.

Owl Carousel: A responsive carousel used to showcase testimonials and client feedback.


3.2 Backend

The backend is powered by Python, specifically using the Flask web framework. Flask provides a simple yet powerful way to handle routes, user authentication, meeting scheduling, and integration with payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe.

3.3 Database

For this project, SQLite is used as the database (although you can configure other databases if needed). The database stores data related to users, attorneys, appointments, and payment details. It is lightweight and ideal for local development, though it can be switched out for more robust solutions in production.
